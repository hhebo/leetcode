"""
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:

Input: 3

Output: 5

Explanation:

Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3

    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
